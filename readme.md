# Design Teardown - Smashing Magazine

Project Objectives:
- Create a simple grayscale heat map of the Smashing Magazine website, to indicate which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy (darkest being greatest, lightest being weakest).
- Practice using typography/fonts to see how this affects visual weight and feel of the page/elements.
- Practice positioning

## My Notes:
- While I have replicated the SM layout, the proportions aren't perfect (specifically elements designed to contain text). I've prioritised being able to re-use classes/elements that contain text, rather than making each individual box precisely the correct size. 
    - This will be particularly useful if I decide to expand the project later.
- I've completed just over the height of my viewport and not completed the entire scroll-length. I feel this has given me a good practice of the principles I have learned so far.
- I've only added text to one of the DIVs to practice font/typography as I feel like I lready have a good understanding of this.
    - If you hover on those sections, the heat-map coloring disappears.

### Key learnings
- My eyes were straight away drawn to the nav bar, then the logo in the top-right, and then the profile pictures. I found the profile pictures slightly distracting.
- My eyes were then drawn to the 'email newsletter'/and 'search articles' inputs, but as I hadn't yet consumed any content I didn't particularly want to interact with either.
- I feel more visual weight could be given to the article headlines and previews to draw the user in.
- I also found the way the author, date and article category had different fonts and colours distracting, but this is just my preference. I would have prefered the colors/decoration without the different fonts.

#### It's all subjective so I'm sure everyone will have different views :)
