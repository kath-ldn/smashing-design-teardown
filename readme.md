# Design Teardown (Heat Map) - Smashing Magazine

## About

I created this Heat Map as part of [The Odin Project HTML and CSS module](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/design-teardown).

My objectives were to:
* Create a simple grayscale heat map of the Smashing Magazine website, to indicate which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy (darkest being greatest, lightest being weakest).
* Practice using typography/fonts to see how this affects visual weight and feel of the page/elements.
* Practice positioning.

### My evaluation of the visual hierarchy

* My eyes were straight away drawn to the nav bar, then the logo in the top-right, and then the profile pictures. I found the profile pictures slightly distracting.
* My eyes were then drawn to the 'email newsletter'/and 'search articles' inputs, but as I hadn't yet consumed any content I didn't particularly want to interact with either.
* I feel more visual weight could be given to the article headlines and previews to draw the user in.
* I also found the way the author, date and article category had different fonts and colours distracting, but this is just my preference. I would have prefered the colors/decoration without the different fonts.

### Built with

HTML & CSS

## Prerequisites & Installation

No special requirements.

## Roadmap

None planned.

### Known Issues

* While I have replicated the SM layout, the proportions aren't perfect (specifically elements designed to contain text). I've prioritised being able to re-use classes/elements, rather than making each individual box precisely the correct size. 
* I've completed just over the height of my viewport and not completed the entire scroll-length. I feel this was appropriate for the brief and to practice the principles I have learned so far.
* I've only added text to one of the DIVs to practice font/typography as I feel like I lready have a good understanding of this and have other projects to demonstrate this in. If you hover on those sections, the heat-map coloring disappears.
* I developed this before I did the responsive design classes - therefore the responsiveness is not perfect. Given that it is a heat map rather than a project, I'm not going to spend time fixing this for now.
